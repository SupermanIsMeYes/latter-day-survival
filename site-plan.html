      </p>

      <h3>Why will people come to your site?</h3>
      <p>
        My site will be a place where members of the church can come and find
        doctrine on the second coming as well as strategies to physically
        prepare for the second coming of Jesus Christ as well as spiritually.
      </p>

      <h3>
        What questions will your visitors expect your site to answer for them?
      </h3>
      <p>
        My site will answer questions on doctrine of the second coming. As well
        as how they can prepare physically for the second coming like how they
        can best make cheap food storage or what items should they have in case
        of emergency.
      </p>

      <h3>
        What types of activities will visitors want to complete on your site?
      </h3>
      <p>
        My site is mostly informational, but it will help them understand how
        they can be physically and spiritually prepared for the end of the
        world. it will also teach them what activities will allow them to be so
        prepared.
      </p>

      <h3>
        What information is necessary to complete any actions your site offers?
      </h3>
      <p>
        The information necessary for my site will be the doctrine on the second
        coming including scriptures, teachings of prophets, and other sources.
        My site will also need the ability to show how you can physically be
        prepared for the second coming and follow all the guidance of the
        prophets.
      </p>

      <h3>
        Why will your visitors come to your site instead of another to get this
        information or complete the actions?
      </h3>
      <p>
        My visitors will come to my site instead of others because it will have
        high quality information that will allow them to make decisions in a way
        that will affect them for now and in eternity. My site will also have
        current events that line up with prophecies that many people will find
        very interesting and want to check up on what I post regularly. It will
        also have ways to achieve food independence cheaply and on a budget.

      <p>Spirtual Survival</p>
      <p>
        Spiritual survival: Explain doctrine on the seven seals: I will prove
        that we are currently in the seventh seal From the church web site:
        Revelation’s Seven Seals John’s seven seals give an overview of the
        seven thousand years of earth’s “temporal existence,” as follows: 1.
        (Rev. 6:1–2—about 4000 B.C. to 3000 B.C.) John sees a warrior,
        conquering. 2. (Rev. 6:3–4—about 3000 B.C. to 2000 B.C.) John sees a
        representation of human contention and death. 3. (Rev. 6:5–6—about 2000
        B.C. to 1000 B.C.) John sees images of famine. 4. (Rev. 6:7–8—about 1000
        B.C. to A.D. 1) John sees death by war, famine, beasts. 5. (Rev.
        6:9–11—about A.D. 1 to A.D. 1000) John sees the martyrs for Christ of
        the early Christian era. 6. (About A.D. 1000 to A.D. 2000) Great
        Earthquake (Rev. 6:12–17) **(Earthquake happened at the bigging of the
        seal near year 1000) 7. (About A.D. 2000 to A.D. 3000) Six Judgments
        (Rev. 8 and Rev. 9) Six of seven trumps now sound, signaling six coming
        judgments on the earth: (1) hail and fire mingled with blood are cast
        upon the earth (cf. Ex. 9:22–26; Ezek. 38:22); (2) a great burning
        mountain is cast into the sea (cf. Ex. 7:19–25); (3) a great star falls,
        affecting 1/3 of fresh water; (4) 1/3 of heavenly bodies turn dark (cf.
        Ex. 10:21–23); (5) sun is darkened by smoke; 5-month battle plagues
        mankind, of such extent it is called a “woe”; (6) a 13-month war plagues
        mankind, but men still don’t repent, suggesting clearly the purposes for
        the “judgments of God.” If the church says the seventh seal opens around
        the year 2000 why then are we not in the millennium? Well the reason is
        when the seventh seal was opened there was silence in heaven for 30
        minutes “1 And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in
        heaven about the space of half an hour.” Elder McConkie said this on the
        subject: “A day with the Lord after his manner of reckoning, it being
        1000 years according to the time appointed to that [ whereon thou
        standest."And again:"But beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing,
        that ONE DAY is with the Lord as a THOUSAND YEARS, and a thousand years
        as one day."The next step was to divide 1,000 years by 24 to determine
        what an hour would be according to God’s time. It turned out to be 41.66
        years or just under 42 years. This means that a half hour of God’s time
        would be ? 7 years or nearly 21 years. This would clearly suggest that
        this is the duration of the half hour of silence in heaven and the
        period of time when the angels undertake the calamitous preparation of
        the earth for the Savior’s second coming. Its actually closer to about
        20.5 years. And so what happened in year 2020? Covid and a bunch of
        other stuff……
