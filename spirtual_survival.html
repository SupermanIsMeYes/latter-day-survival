        <h3>
          Spiritual survival: Explain doctrine on the seven seals: I will prove
          that we are currently in the seventh seal From the church web site:
          Revelation’s Seven Seals John’s seven seals give an overview of the
          seven thousand years of earth’s “temporal existence,” as follows: 1.
          (Rev. 6:1–2—about 4000 B.C. to 3000 B.C.) John sees a warrior,
          conquering. 2. (Rev. 6:3–4—about 3000 B.C. to 2000 B.C.) John sees a
          representation of human contention and death. 3. (Rev. 6:5–6—about
          2000 B.C. to 1000 B.C.) John sees images of famine. 4. (Rev.
          6:7–8—about 1000 B.C. to A.D. 1) John sees death by war, famine,
          beasts. 5. (Rev. 6:9–11—about A.D. 1 to A.D. 1000) John sees the
          martyrs for Christ of the early Christian era. 6. (About A.D. 1000 to
          A.D. 2000) Great Earthquake (Rev. 6:12–17) **(Earthquake happened at
          the bigging of the seal near year 1000) 7. (About A.D. 2000 to A.D.
          3000) Six Judgments (Rev. 8 and Rev. 9) Six of seven trumps now sound,
          signaling six coming judgments on the earth: (1) hail and fire mingled
          with blood are cast upon the earth (cf. Ex. 9:22–26; Ezek. 38:22); (2)
          a great burning mountain is cast into the sea (cf. Ex. 7:19–25); (3) a
          great star falls, affecting 1/3 of fresh water; (4) 1/3 of heavenly
          bodies turn dark (cf. Ex. 10:21–23); (5) sun is darkened by smoke;
          5-month battle plagues mankind, of such extent it is called a “woe”;
          (6) a 13-month war plagues mankind, but men still don’t repent,
          suggesting clearly the purposes for the “judgments of God.” If the
          church says the seventh seal opens around the year 2000 why then are
          we not in the millennium?

        <h1>The 30 minutes of silence</h1>
        <img src="./pics/elder McConkie.jpg" alt="elder mcconkie" />
        <h3>
          Well the reason is when the seventh seal was opened there was silence
          in heaven for 30 minutes “1 And when he had opened the seventh seal,
          there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour.” Elder
          McConkie said this on the subject: “A day with the Lord after his
          manner of reckoning, it being 1000 years according to the time
          appointed to that [ whereon thou standest."And again:"But beloved, be
          not ignorant of this one thing, that ONE DAY is with the Lord as a
          THOUSAND YEARS, and a thousand years as one day."The next step was to
          divide 1,000 years by 24 to determine what an hour would be according
          to God’s time. It turned out to be 41.66 years or just under 42 years.
          This means that a half hour of God’s time would be ? 7 years or nearly
          21 years. This would clearly suggest that this is the duration of the
          half hour of silence in heaven and the period of time when the angels
          undertake the calamitous preparation of the earth for the Savior’s
          second coming. Its actually closer to about 20.5 years. And so what
          happened in year 2020? Covid and a bunch of other stuff……

          march 18 2020 there was an Earthquake in utah that knocked off the
          horn of moroni. Two days before the first lock downs from Covid.
          Fulfilling the prophecy.
